# tetris-terminal-game

Tetris Clone.  Runs in terminal.  Implemented in Python3 using ncurses library.

## Setup

To run, type:

```
python3 tetris.py
```

Note that the game currently only runs on macOS with Python 3+!

## Objective

Clear lines by placing tetris pieces strategically.
If the pieces stack up to the top, you lose.
Try to get to level 11!

## Controls

"up arrow" - rotate piece
"down arrow" - make piece fall faster
"right arrow" - move piece right
"left arrow" - move piece left
"p" - pause game
"q" - quit game

## What was the original motivation?

A friend (@jordonwii) told @epai that animation in the terminal couldn't be done.  @epai wanted to prove him wrong, and then some.  So @epai started implementing a full functioning tetris in the terminal. :)
