# tetris-terminal-game

Tetris Clone.  Runs in terminal.  Implemented in Python using ncurses library.

***IMPORTANT:  MUST HAVE PYTHON3 INSTALLED TO RUN!***

## Setup

To run, type:

```
python3 tetris.py
```

## Objective

Clear lines by placing tetris pieces strategically.
If the pieces stack up to the top, you lose.
Try to get to level 11!

## Controls

"up arrow" - rotate piece
"down arrow" - make piece fall faster
"right arrow" - move piece right
"left arrow" - move piece left
"p" - pause game
"q" - quit game

Thanks for playing!

- wall kicking
- line completion (sort of)
- "levels" and associated falling speeds (YES!)

## P.S. What was my motivation?
A friend told me that animation in the terminal couldn't be done.  I wanted to prove him wrong, and then some.  So I implemented a full functioning tetris in the terminal. :)
